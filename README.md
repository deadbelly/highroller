# highroller

This is a simple dice rolling site. I'm using this as a way of testing what I've learned of JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I'll probably build it very slowly on my weekends and at night, if I'm not working on other coding projects for online classes. Once I've finished I plan to keep it updated with any new techniques or ideas I think could improve it.
